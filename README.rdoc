# SelFeed

SelFeed is a clone of the popular mobile social picture-sharing platform, Instagram,
built for the web using Rails and Backbone. Users upload pictures with a custom
widget that allows for cropping and filter effects. Pictures can be viewed several
ways: in your personal feed of followed users, on a user's profile page, or through the
"explore" feature, which displays recent uploads geographically. The app also includes
full social functionality, including following users, likes, and commenting.
